# DiamondCareSite
Website layout for an "unfinished" beauty salon and I have no intention of finishing XD.

Made mostly in HTML and CSS, with a line or two of PHP and JS.
I used the Bootstrap framework.

## Final notes
This was supposed to be a school project, but the idea was discarded. The project was halted in the middle of development, and I don't want to finish it. There are some issues with the responsiveness, mainly with the carousel.
